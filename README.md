  <h2>Devlog or something.</h2>
  <p>Trying several things on several projects.Can't just stand with one project sadly because i have ADHD.Trying my best to update
  most of the projects.Especially the OpenGL OBJ Loader project.I know the OpenGL OBJ Loader got updated like last 2 months ago but
  believe me.I am really working on it.I know where the problem actually happens to be existing.I can't update daily because i got
  school.I just update when i have free times.Programming is just a hobby of me, for now.
  
  Currently Learning : Pygame
  
  Libraries in interest : OpenGL, LibTorch/PyTorch, GLFW

  Exams started so it'll take me longer than ever to update repos.
